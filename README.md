# data_used_in_article
Here are the relevant data and code used in the article "In-Situ Measurement Method for Solid-Liquid Coupling Based on Multi-Wavelength Collaboration and Improved Graph Neural Network"

This includes the dataset obtained through Zemax simulation software used in the article,named"dataset"

The MATLAB file here is the implementation of multi wavelength collaboration method

The Python file here is the implementation of ResGAT

The data at the conclusion of the paper are all saved in the "data in article" file

Thanks for your inquiry
